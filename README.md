# hello-world
It contains everything about the evolution of my project, feel free to comment:)
I am a seventeen years old boy, I am now cursing the second year of the high school at Pedro II, a very renomed school of Rio de Janeiro. I like to learn new things all the time, that's why I ended up on Github.
